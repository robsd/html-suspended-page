# html-suspended-page ⚠️

A simple page to put on a client's website who is avoiding paying you for it (sigh).

## How to use it

1. [Download](https://github.com/robsd/html-suspended-page/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract this repo.
2. Move all of your client's website files into a subdirectory with a name that only you would know e.g. **example54321**.
3. Upload the **index.html** suspended page to the root directory of your client's website.

## How to remove it / restore your client's website

1. Delete the **index.html** suspended page you put in the root directory of your client's website.
2. Move everything from the random subdirectory you put everything in e.g. **example54321**, back into the root directory of your client's website.

## IMPORTANT NOTICE

- I accept no responsibility for how this page is used, any damage or disputes it causes.

## Need a hint?

- If your client has their own cPanel account, the root directory could be **index_html**.
- If your client's website is stored on a cPanel account with other websites, the root directory may be called the domain name e.g. **example.com**.
